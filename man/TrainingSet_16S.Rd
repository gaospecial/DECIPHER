\title{Training Set for Classification of 16S rRNA Gene Sequences}
\format{
A training set of class 'Taxa' * K-mer size: 8 * Number of rank
levels: 10 * Total number of sequences: 2472 * Number of taxonomic groups:
2472 * Number of problem groups: 5 * Number of problem sequences: 8
}
\source{
Derived from version 16 of the RDP Training Set
(\url{http://rdp.cme.msu.edu}) based on Bergey's Manual.
}
\description{
A pre-trained classifier for 16S rRNA gene sequences generated by
\code{\link{LearnTaxa}}.
}
\details{
The original training sequences were pruned to a maximum of one sequence per
group, as described in the 'Classifying Sequences' vignette.
}
\note{
This 16S rRNA training set is provided for illustrative purposes only.
It is highly recommended to use a more comprehensive training set when
classifying real sequences.  Examples of comprehensive training sets can be
found at \url{http://DECIPHER.codes/Download.html}.
