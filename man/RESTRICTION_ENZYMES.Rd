\description{
A character vector of common restriction sites named by the restriction
enzyme that cuts at each site.  Sequence specificity is listed in 5' to 3'
orientation based on the \code{IUPAC_CODE_MAP}.  The cut site is either
signified by a ``/'' for palindromic sites, or two numbers giving the
position of the top and bottom cut positions relative to the site's 3'-end.
