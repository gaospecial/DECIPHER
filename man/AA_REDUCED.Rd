\title{Reduced amino acid alphabets}
\format{
An object of class \code{list} of length 160.
}
\usage{
AA_REDUCED
}
\description{
The \code{AA_REDUCED} list contains reductions of the standard amino acid
alphabet (\code{AA_STANDARD}).
}
\details{
Reduced amino alphabets can sometimes improve sensitivity and specificity of
finding homologous matches between amino acid sequences.  The first 12
\code{AA_REDUCED} alphabets were optimized for finding synteny between
genomic sequences.  The next 113 alphabets are from a review of published
amino acid alphabets (Solis, 2015). The following 17 alphabets were
optimized for amino acid classification. The final 18 alphabets are
progressive mergers based on average similarities in \code{PFASUM}.
