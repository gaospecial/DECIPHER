\usage{
MaskAlignment(
  myXStringSet,
  type = "sequences",
  windowSize = 5,
  threshold = 1,
  maxFractionGaps = 0.2,
  includeTerminalGaps = FALSE,
  correction = FALSE,
  randomBackground = FALSE,
  showPlot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{myXStringSet}{An \code{AAStringSet}, \code{DNAStringSet}, or
\code{RNAStringSet} object of aligned sequences.}

\item{type}{Character string indicating the type of result desired.  This
should be (an abbreviation of) one of \code{"sequences"}, \code{"ranges"},
or \code{"values"}.  (See value section below.)}

\item{windowSize}{Integer value specifying the size of the region to the
left and right of the center-point to use in calculating the moving average.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric giving the average entropy in bits below which a
region is masked.}

\item{maxFractionGaps}{Numeric specifying the maximum faction of gaps in an
alignment column to be masked.}

\item{includeTerminalGaps}{Logical specifying whether or not to include
terminal gaps ("." or "-" characters on each end of the sequences) into the
calculation of gap fraction.}

\item{correction}{Logical indicating whether to apply a small-sample size
correction to columns with few letters (Yu et al., 2015).}

\item{randomBackground}{Logical determining whether background letter
frequencies are determined directly from \code{myXStringSet} (the default)
or an uniform distribution of letters.}

\item{showPlot}{Logical specifying whether or not to show a plot of the
positions that were kept or masked.}
}
\value{
If \code{type} is \code{"sequences"} then a \code{MultipleAlignment}
object of the input type with masked columns where the input criteria are
met. Otherwise, if \code{type} is \code{"ranges"} then an \code{IRanges}
object giving the start and end positions of the masked columns.  Else
(\code{type} is \code{"values"}) a \code{data.frame} containing one row per
site in the alignment and three columns of information: \item{"entropy"}{
The entropy score of each column, in units of bits. } \item{"gaps"}{ For
each column, the fraction of gap characters ("-" or "."). } \item{"mask"}{ A
logical vector indicating whether or not the column met the criteria for
masking. }
}
\description{
Automatically masks poorly aligned regions of an alignment based on sequence
conservation and gap frequency.
}
\details{
Poorly aligned regions of a multiple sequence alignment may lead to
incorrect results in downstream analyses.  One method to mitigate their
effects is to mask columns of the alignment that may be poorly aligned, such
as highly-variable regions or regions with many insertions and deletions
(gaps).

Highly variable regions are detected by their signature of having a low
information content.  Here, information content is defined by the relative
entropy of a column in the alignment (Yu et al., 2015), which is higher for
conserved columns.  The relative entropy is based on the background
distribution of letter-frequencies in the alignment.

A moving average of \code{windowSize} nucleotides to the left and right of
the center-point is applied to smooth noise in the information content
signal along the sequence.  Regions dropping below \code{threshold} bits or
more than \code{maxFractionGaps} are masked.

fas <- system.file("extdata", "Streptomyces_ITS_aligned.fas", package="DECIPHER")
dna <- readDNAStringSet(fas)
masked_dna <- MaskAlignment(dna, showPlot=TRUE)

# display only unmasked nucleotides for use in downstream analyses
not_masked <- as(masked_dna, "DNAStringSet")
BrowseSeqs(not_masked)

# display only masked nucleotides that are covered by the mask
masked <- masked_dna
colmask(masked, append="replace", invert=TRUE) <- colmask(masked)
masked <- as(masked, "DNAStringSet")
BrowseSeqs(masked)

# display the complete DNA sequence set including the mask
masks <- lapply(width(colmask(masked_dna)), rep, x="+")
masks <- unlist(lapply(masks, paste, collapse=""))
masked_dna <- replaceAt(dna, at=IRanges(colmask(masked_dna)), value=masks)
BrowseSeqs(masked_dna)

# get the start and end ranges of masked columns
ranges <- MaskAlignment(dna, type="ranges")
ranges
replaceAt(dna, ranges) # remove the masked columns

# obtain the entropy scores of each column
values <- MaskAlignment(dna, type="values")
head(values)
