\title{Tools for curating, analyzing, and manipulating biological sequences}
\description{
DECIPHER is a software toolset that can be used for deciphering and managing
biological sequences efficiently using the R statistical programming
language.  The program is designed to be used with non-destructive workflows
for importing, maintaining, analyzing, manipulating, and exporting a massive
amount of sequences.
