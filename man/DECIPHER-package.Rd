Tools for curating, analyzing, and manipulating biological sequences
}
\description{
DECIPHER is a software toolset that can be used for deciphering and managing biological sequences efficiently using the R statistical programming language.  The program is designed to be used with non-destructive workflows for importing, maintaining, analyzing, manipulating, and exporting a massive amount of sequences.
