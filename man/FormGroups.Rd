\title{Forms Groups By Rank}
\usage{
FormGroups(
  dbFile,
  tblName = "Seqs",
  goalSize = 50,
  minGroupSize = 25,
  maxGroupSize = 5000,
  includeNames = FALSE,
  add2tbl = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dbFile}{A SQLite connection object or a character string specifying
the path to the database file.}

\item{tblName}{Character string specifying the table where the rank
information is located.}

\item{goalSize}{Number of sequences required in each group to stop adding
more sequences.}

\item{minGroupSize}{Minimum number of sequences in each group required to
stop trying to recombine with a larger group.}

\item{maxGroupSize}{Maximum number of sequences in each group allowed to
continue agglomeration.}

\item{includeNames}{Logical indicating whether to include the formal
scientific name in the group name.}

\item{add2tbl}{Logical or a character string specifying the table name in
which to add the result.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to display progress.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the \code{rank} and corresponding group
name as \code{identifier}.  Note that quotes are stripped from group names
to prevent problems that they may cause.  The \code{origin} gives the
\code{rank} preceding the \code{identifier}.  The \code{count} denotes
number of sequences corresponding to each \code{rank}.  If \code{add2tbl} is
not \code{FALSE} then the \verb{identifier'' and }origin'' columns are updated
in \code{dbFile}.
}
\description{
Agglomerates sequences into groups within a specified size range based on
taxonomic rank.
}
\details{
\code{FormGroups} uses the ``rank'' field in the \code{dbFile} table to
group sequences with similar taxonomic rank.  Rank information must be
present in the \code{tblName}, such as that created by default when
importing sequences from a GenBank formatted file.

Rank information contains the formal scientific name on the first line,
followed by the taxonomic lineage on subsequent lines.  When
\code{includeNames} is \code{TRUE} the formal scientific name is appended to
the end of the group name, otherwise only the taxonomic lineage is used as
the group name.

The algorithm ascends the taxonomic tree, agglomerating taxa into groups
until the \code{goalSize} is reached.  If the group size is below
\code{minGroupSize} then further agglomeration is attempted with a larger
group.  If additional agglomeration results in a group larger than
\code{maxGroupSize} then the agglomeration is undone so that the group is
smaller.  Setting \code{minGroupSize} to \code{goalSize} avoids the creation
of polyphyletic groups.  Note that this approach may often result in
paraphyletic groups.
