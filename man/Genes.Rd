\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{Genes}.}

\item{xlim}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying the x-axis limits for
plotting.}

\item{ylim}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying the y-axis limits for
plotting.}

\item{interact}{Logical determining whether the plot is interactive.  If
\code{TRUE}, clicking the plot on the right or left side will scroll one
frame in that direction.  To end interaction, either right-click, press the
escape key, or press the stop button depending on the graphics device in
use.}

\item{colorBy}{Character string indicating the name of the column in
\code{x} that should be used for coloring.  Unambiguous abbreviations are
also permitted.}

\item{colorRamp}{A function that will return \code{n} colors when given a
number \code{n}.  Examples are \code{rainbow}, \code{heat.colors},
\code{terrain.colors}, \code{cm.colors}, or (the default)
\code{colorRampPalette}.}

\item{colorGenes}{Character string specifying the color of genes, or
\code{NA} to color genes according to \code{colorBy}.}

\item{i}{Numeric or character vector of row indices to extract from
\code{x}.}

\item{j}{Numeric or character vector of column indices to extract from
\code{x}.  If \code{j} is missing, all columns are included and the returned
object will also belong to class \code{Genes}.}

\item{\dots}{Other optional parameters.}

\description{
Gene prediction consist of delimiting the boundaries of regions that
function as genes within a genome.  Class \code{Genes} provides objects and
functions for storing the boundaries of genes and associated information
resulting from gene prediction.

\details{
Objects of class \code{Genes} are stored as numeric matrices containing
information pertaining to gene predictions.  The matrix columns include the
index (\code{"Index"}) of the corresponding sequence in the original genome,
the strand (\code{"Strand"}) where the gene is located (either \code{"+"}
(\code{0}) or \code{"-"} (\code{1}), the beginning (\code{"Begin"}) and
ending (\code{"End"}) positions of the gene, scores acquired during
prediction, and whether (\code{!= 0}) or not (\code{0}) the region was
predicted to be a gene.  Note that the start of the gene is at the beginning
position when the strand is \code{"+"} and end when the strand is
\code{"-"}.  By convention, rows with negative values in the \code{"Gene"}
column represent non-coding RNAs and rows with positive values represent
protein coding genes.

The \code{plot} method will show the total score of each prediction along
the genome.  This is most useful when displaying the result of setting
\code{allScores} to \code{TRUE} in \code{FindGenes}.  Here, possible genes
on either strand will be shown (by default), with the predicted genes
highlighted.  The beginning (solid) and ending (dashed) positions are
denoted by vertical lines.  Note that the x-axis is cumulative genome
position, and changes between genome sequences indices are demarcated by
dashed vertical lines.
