\title{NonCoding Models for Common Non-Coding RNA Families}
\source{
Models were built from sequences belonging to families in tRNADB-CE
(\url{http://trna.ie.niigata-u.ac.jp/cgi-bin/trnadb/index.cgi}) or Rfam
(\url{http://rfam.xfam.org}).
}
\description{
Pre-trained with \code{NonCoding} models for common RNA families found in
genomes from organisms belonging to each domain of life.
}
\details{
A set of \code{NonCoding} models contained in a named list.  Models were
built from up to 1000 representative sequences per non-coding RNA family.
